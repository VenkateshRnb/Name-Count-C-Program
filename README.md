# Name-Count-C-Program/

#### Initial Note:
- It was a first challenge given by my friend when I started Programming.
- When I was beginner, This challenge boosted my confidence to learn further.
- I thought of optimising this code further but I felt not to modify the original one.

#### What is it?
- It is a C program that computes the sum of numbers corresponding to each alphabet in a given string.
Here, Each Letter corresponds to a number according to their alphabetical order. Lets say, a=1, b=2,c=3.... and so on.

#### Example:

 When input is given as "alex", It prints out 42 as an output.
 That is, alex = 1+12+5+24 = 42
